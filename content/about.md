## Who I Am

Cloud Infrastructure Engineer with over 4 years of experience building and automating infrastructure on AWS. I write Python and shell scripts to solve problems, run Linux everywhere I can, and believe that if you're doing something more than twice, it should be automated.

I'm exploring serverless and event-driven architectures, working with AWS services, and sharing what I build along the way.

Outside of work, I like tinkering with electronics and IoT projects - automating things in the physical world is just as satisfying as automating cloud infrastructure.

Based in Pernambuco, Brazil, working remotely.

## What I Do

- **Automation** - If it can be scripted, it will be. Python and Bash are my tools of choice
- **Serverless Architecture** - Lambda functions, API Gateway, event-driven workflows
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform and Ansible for reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure
- **Cloud Operations** - Monitoring, incident response, and keeping systems running smoothly

Welcome to my blog. Here i will share insights, tutorials, and lessons learned from my experience as a Cloud Engineer.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Python and Shell Automation** - Scripts, patterns, and tools that make life easier
- **Serverless and APIs** - Building event-driven systems with Lambda, API Gateway, and friends
- **AWS Deep Dives** - Lessons learned from real-world implementations
- **Linux** - Tips, tricks, and why i run it on everything
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform and Ansible patterns that actually work
- **IoT and Electronics** - Hardware projects, home automation, and making things blink

As i continue learning, expect posts on CI/CD pipelines, observability, and maybe some explorations into how infrastructure meets data-driven systems. The cloud is evolving fast, and i plan to evolve with it.

## Why blog

Writing helps me organize my thoughts and reinforces learning. If my experiences help someone else solve a problem or avoid a pitfall, even better. Plus, debugging your own writing is a lot like debugging code - you always find something you missed.
